          >First Person View (FPV) drone racing is a competition where pilots
          control drones equipped with cameras while wearing goggles that stream
          the live video feed from the drones so they feel like theyâ€™re flying
          from inside the drone. The goal is to complete a complex race course
          as quickly as possible and ahead of the other pilots in the heat.
          Competitions are held in stadiums around the world and also with some
          pilots flying virtually in the DRL SIM, the true-to-life drone racing
          simulator.</span
